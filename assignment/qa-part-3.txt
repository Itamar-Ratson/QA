Part 3: End-to-End Testing Strategy (2 hours)

Scenario: Multi-Tier Application Deployment
Design a comprehensive testing approach for the following user workflow:

Business Scenario: A development team wants to deploy a 3-tier web application with proper
network isolation and security controls using your VPC feature.

Infrastructure Requirements:
	1. Create a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) in us-east-1
	2. Create three subnets:Public subnet (10.0.1.0/24) for load balancer
		Private subnet (10.0.2.0/24) for application servers
		Database subnet (10.0.3.0/24) for database
	3. Configure Internet Gateway for public access
	4. Set up NAT Gateway for private subnet outbound access
	5. Create security groups for each tier with appropriate rules
	6. Deploy Application Load Balancer in public subnet
	7. Launch 2 application instances in private subnet
	8. Set up RDS MySQL database in database subnet

Deliverables for Part 3:
1. Test Strategy Document including:
	Testing approach overview
	Test objectives and scope
	Key testing scenarios
	Risk assessment
	Success criteria
2. Detailed Test Plan with:
	Step-by-step execution plan
	Validation checkpoints
	Expected results at each stage
	Rollback procedures if issues are found
3. Testing Considerations for:
	Network connectivity between tiersSecurity isolation verification
	Performance and scalability aspects
	Integration points with other services
