Part 4: API Testing Approach (1 hour)

VPC Management API
	You have access to REST API endpoints for VPC management. Design test scenarios for the
	following API operations:

	Available Endpoints:
		POST /v1/vpcs
		GET /v1/vpcs
		GET /v1/vpcs/{vpc_id}
		PUT /v1/vpcs/{vpc_id}
		DELETE /v1/vpcs/{vpc_id}

	Sample API Request:
		json
		POST /v1/vpcs
		{
		"name": "my-vpc",
		"cidr_block": "10.0.0.0/16",
		"region": "us-east-1",
		"enable_dns_resolution": true,
		"enable_dns_hostnames": false
		}

	Deliverables for Part 4:
	1. API Test Scenarios covering:
		CRUD operations testing
		Input validation
		Authentication and authorization
		Error handling
		Rate limiting
		Concurrent request handling
	2. Test Implementation Plan:
		Testing tools/framework recommendation
		Test data setup requirements
		Expected response codes and payloads
		Performance baseline suggestions
