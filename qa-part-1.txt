Part 1: Test Case Design (2-3 hours)

Feature Specification: VPC Creation
	You are tasked with testing a new VPC creation feature with the following requirements:

Functional Requirements:
	Users can create a Virtual Private Cloud with a specified CIDR block
	CIDR block must be between /16 and /28 (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16, 192.168.1.0/24)
	VPC names must be 1-255 characters long, containing only alphanumeric characters,
	hyphens, and underscores
	Each account is limited to 5 VPCs per region
	VPC creation must complete within 30 seconds under normal conditions
	DNS resolution and DNS hostnames can be enabled or disabled (both optional)
	VPC must be created in a specific availability zone region

Technical Constraints:
	CIDR blocks cannot overlap with existing VPCs in the same region
	Private IP ranges only (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16)
	System must handle concurrent VPC creation requests

User Interface:
	Web-based form with fields for VPC name, CIDR block, region selection, and DNS options
	Real-time validation for CIDR format
	Success/error messaging

Deliverables for Part 1:
	1. Comprehensive Test Cases covering:
		Positive/Happy path scenarios
		Boundary value testing
		Negative testing scenarios
		Edge cases
		Integration scenarios
	2. Test Case Format should include:
		Test case ID
		Test case description
		Pre-conditions
		Test steps
		Expected results
		Priority (High/Medium/Low)
		Category (Functional/UI/API/Performance/Security)
