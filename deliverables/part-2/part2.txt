**Reporter:** QA Team  
**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Environment:** Staging environment, us-west-2 region

## Description
DNS resolution fails for instances within VPC despite DNS resolution being enabled during VPC creation. Domain name queries fail even though VPC creation was successful and DNS settings appear correctly configured.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to VPC creation form
2. Enter VPC name (e.g., "dns-test-vpc")
3. Input valid CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
4. Select region: us-west-2
5. Enable "DNS resolution" option
6. Click "Create VPC" - VPC creates successfully
7. Launch instances within the VPC
8. Attempt DNS queries from instances (e.g., nslookup google.com)
9. Observe DNS resolution failure

## Expected Behavior
- DNS resolution should work for instances within VPC when DNS resolution is enabled
- Domain names should resolve to IP addresses
- Both internal and external DNS queries should function
- DNS hostnames should be resolvable if enabled

## Actual Behavior
- VPC creation succeeds with DNS resolution enabled
- Instances launch successfully within VPC
- DNS queries fail from instances
- Domain names cannot be resolved
- No clear error indication during VPC creation process

## Environment Details
- **Environment:** Staging
- **Region:** us-west-2
- **VPC Creation:** Successful
- **Instance Launch:** Successful
- **DNS Resolution:** Enabled during creation
- **DNS Hostnames:** Status unknown

## Severity Assessment
**HIGH** - Critical functionality failure affecting instance connectivity

## Priority Recommendation
**HIGH** - Blocks normal instance operations and network functionality

## Additional Evidence
- VPC shows as successfully created
- DNS resolution setting appears enabled in VPC configuration
- All other VPC functionality works normally
- Issue specific to DNS resolution functionality

# Bug Report: CIDR Validation Inconsistency

##################################################

## Bug Details

**Bug ID:** VPC-003  
**Bug Title:** UI Accepts Invalid CIDR Block That Backend Rejects  
**Reporter:** QA Team  
**Date:** July 17, 2025  
**Environment:** Both staging and production

## Description
System accepts CIDR block 10.0.0.0/15 in UI real-time validation but fails during backend creation process, creating inconsistent validation experience between frontend and backend.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to VPC creation form
2. Enter VPC name (e.g., "cidr-test-vpc")
3. Input CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/15
4. Select any region
5. Configure DNS settings (any configuration)
6. Observe UI validation passes (no error shown)
7. Click "Create VPC"
8. Observe backend validation failure after form submission

## Expected Behavior
- UI validation should reject CIDR blocks outside /16 to /28 range
- Backend and frontend validation should be consistent
- User should receive immediate feedback for invalid CIDR
- No form submission should occur with invalid CIDR

## Actual Behavior
- UI real-time validation accepts 10.0.0.0/15 (invalid per requirements)
- Form submission proceeds successfully
- Backend validation fails after submission
- User experiences delayed error feedback
- Inconsistent validation rules between UI and backend

## Environment Details
- **Environment:** Both staging and production
- **CIDR Block:** 10.0.0.0/15 (invalid - outside /16 to /28 range)
- **Validation Point:** UI passes, backend fails
- **Error Timing:** Post-submission

## Severity Assessment
**MEDIUM** - Functional issue affecting user experience and validation consistency

## Priority Recommendation
**MEDIUM** - Should be fixed to maintain validation consistency and user experience

## Additional Evidence
- Requirements specify /16 to /28 CIDR range
- /15 is larger than /16 minimum, therefore invalid
- Issue occurs in both environments
- Real-time validation logic differs from backend validation
