# Test Strategy Document: Multi-Tier Application Deployment

## Testing Approach Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for validating a 3-tier web application deployment using VPC infrastructure.

**Testing Methodology**: Bottom-up testing approach where infrastructure components are validated individually before testing integrated functionality (infrastructure → network → application), ensuring each layer functions correctly before building upon it.

## Test Objectives and Scope

### Primary Objectives
- **Infrastructure Validation**: Verify all VPC components are correctly provisioned and configured
- **Network Connectivity**: Ensure proper traffic flow between all tiers with intended restrictions
- **Security Compliance**: Validate network isolation and security group effectiveness
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance metrics for the deployed architecture
- **Integration Verification**: Confirm seamless interaction between all application components

### Scope
- VPC creation and configuration (10.0.0.0/16 in us-east-1)
- Subnet deployment and routing (public, private, database tiers)
- Gateway configuration (Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway)
- Security group implementation and rule validation
- Application Load Balancer deployment and configuration
- EC2 instance deployment in private subnet
- RDS MySQL database setup in database subnet
- End-to-end application functionality testing

## Key Testing Scenarios

### Infrastructure Provisioning Tests
- **VPC Creation**: Validate VPC with correct CIDR block and region
- **Subnet Configuration**: Verify three subnets with proper CIDR allocation
- **Gateway Deployment**: Confirm IGW and NAT Gateway functionality
- **Route Table Setup**: Validate routing rules for each subnet type

### Network Connectivity Tests
- **Public Tier Access**: Internet → ALB → Application servers
- **Private Tier Communication**: ALB → Application servers → Database
- **Outbound Access**: Application servers → Internet via NAT Gateway
- **Internal Communication**: Application servers ↔ Database servers

### Security Isolation Tests
- **Tier Separation**: Verify no direct access between inappropriate tiers
- **Security Group Rules**: Validate port restrictions and source limitations
- **Database Isolation**: Confirm database accessible only from application tier
- **Public Access Restrictions**: Ensure private resources remain private

### Performance and Load Tests
- **Connection Limits**: Test maximum concurrent connections
- **Response Times**: Baseline latency between tiers
- **Throughput Testing**: Database and application performance under load
- **Auto-scaling Behavior**: If configured, test scaling triggers

### Integration Validation Tests
- **Application Deployment**: Full application stack functionality
- **Database Connectivity**: Application → Database communication
- **Load Balancer Health Checks**: ALB health check validation
- **Session Management**: User session persistence across instances

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- Security Group Misconfiguration
- Network Routing Issues
- Database Connectivity Failure
- Load Balancer Misconfiguration

### Medium Risk Areas
- NAT Gateway failure affecting outbound connectivity
- Subnet CIDR conflicts during expansion
- Performance degradation under load
- SSL/TLS certificate issues

### Low Risk Areas
- VPC creation failure (well-tested AWS service)
- Basic EC2 instance provisioning
- RDS database creation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- **Complete Infrastructure Deployment**: All components provisioned without errors
- **Network Connectivity**: 100% successful connectivity tests between appropriate tiers
- **Security Validation**: Zero unauthorized access attempts succeed
- **Application Functionality**: Full user workflow completion rate ≥ 99%
- **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations execute successfully

### Performance Success Criteria
- **Response Time**: ALB → Application server latency < 100ms
- **Database Queries**: Application → Database response < 200ms
- **Throughput**: System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during testing period

### Security Success Criteria
- **Access Control**: No successful unauthorized tier access
- **Data Protection**: Database accessible only from application tier
- **Traffic Encryption**: All inter-tier communication properly encrypted
- **Compliance**: Security groups follow principle of least privilege

### Integration Success Criteria
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Complete user journey from web request to database response
- **Load Distribution**: Traffic evenly distributed across application instances
- **Health Monitoring**: All health checks return positive status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when components are unavailable
