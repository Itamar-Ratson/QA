# Testing Considerations: Multi-Tier Application Deployment

## Network Connectivity Between Tiers

**Testing Approach:**
- Verify routing between public subnet (ALB), private subnet (app servers), and database subnet
- Test connectivity paths: Internet → ALB → App Servers → Database
- Validate NAT Gateway provides outbound access for private subnet
- Confirm cross-AZ communication within the VPC

**Validation Methods:**
- Telnet/nc testing for specific ports (80, 8080, 3306)
- Traceroute to verify routing paths
- DNS resolution testing between tiers
- Network latency measurement between components

## Security Isolation Verification

**Testing Approach:**
- Validate security group rules enforce proper tier isolation
- Confirm database is only accessible from application tier
- Verify no direct internet access to private resources
- Test unauthorized access attempts fail appropriately

**Validation Methods:**
- Attempt direct database connection from internet (should fail)
- Test application server access bypassing ALB (should fail)  
- Port scanning from unauthorized sources
- Security group rule validation against requirements

## Performance and Scalability Aspects

**Testing Approach:**
- Establish performance baselines for each tier
- Test system behavior under increasing load
- Validate load balancer distributes traffic effectively
- Measure response times and throughput limits

**Validation Methods:**
- Load testing with Apache Bench (ab) for HTTP traffic
- Database connection and query performance testing
- Concurrent user simulation up to expected capacity
- Resource utilization monitoring during load tests

## Integration Points with Other Services

**Testing Approach:**
- Verify ALB health checks function correctly
- Test application-to-database connectivity and transactions
- Validate monitoring and logging integration
- Confirm infrastructure provisioning consistency

**Validation Methods:**
- ALB target health status verification
- Database connection pooling and transaction testing
- CloudWatch metrics collection validation
- Terraform deployment repeatability testing
