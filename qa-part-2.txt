Part 2: Bug Investigation and Reporting (2-3 hours)

Scenario
	You've been given access to a staging environment where users have reported issues with the
	VPC feature. Investigate the following problems and provide detailed bug reports.

Issue 1: "VPC Creation Sometimes Fails"
	User Report: "When I try to create a VPC with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16, it sometimes works and
	sometimes gives an error message 'Creation failed - please try again'"
	Frequency: Reported by 3 different users
	Environment: Staging environment, us-east-1 region
	Additional Info: Seems to happen more frequently during peak hours

Issue 2: "DNS Settings Not Working"
	User Report: "I enabled DNS resolution when creating my VPC, but instances can't resolve
	domain names"
	Environment: Staging environment, us-west-2 region
	Additional Info: User created VPC successfully, launched instances, but DNS queries fail

Issue 3: "CIDR Validation Inconsistency"
	User Report: "The system accepted my CIDR block 10.0.0.0/15 in the UI, but then failed
	during creation"
	Environment: Both staging and production
	Additional Info: Error occurs after form submission, not during real-time validation
